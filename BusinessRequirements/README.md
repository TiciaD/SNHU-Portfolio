# SNHU Systems Analysis and Design Projects
## Overview

You work for a small consulting company that designs systems for various clients. Your project lead has assigned you to a new client, DriverPass. DriverPass noticed that there are very few tools that train students to pass their driving tests. DriverPass wants to provide students with access to online practice exams and on-the-road training to better prepare them for driving tests. DriverPass wants your help in designing a system that can handle these needs. Representatives from your company already conducted an interview with DriverPass to determine their needs. Your project lead has recently assigned you to take over as the systems analyst for the DriverPass project. She has asked you to complete a business requirements document that accurately captures DriverPassâ€™s needs as well as complete a system design document, which will include several UML diagrams and a description of the technical requirements for the DriverPass system.

## Key Points
- What does the client want the system to do?
- Who will be the different users of the system? What will each user need to be able to do?
- What are the different requirements for the system?
- Choose two use cases and create two UML activity diagrams, one for each use case.
- For one of the use cases you chose, create a UML sequence diagram.
- Create a UML class diagram it should include the different classes and attributes needed for your system design
- Describe the technical requirements of your proposed system based on the different functional and nonfunctional requirements you included in your business requirements document
