# SNHU Client/Server Development
## Overview
Grazioso Salvare identifies dogs that are good candidates for search-and-rescue training. Grazioso Salvare looks for certain profiles in dogs to train and are seeking a software application that can work with existing data from the animal shelters to identify and categorize available dogs. Global Rain has contracted for a full stack development of this application, including a database and a client-facing web application dashboard through which users at Grazioso Salvare will access the database.

## Requirements
- Develop a database and a Python module enabling CRUD functionality for MongoDB
- Create a fully functional MongoDB dashboard that includes:
  - Interactive options to filter the Austin Animal Center Outcomes data set
  - A data table which dynamically responds to the filtering options
  - A geolocation chart and a second chart of your choice that dynamically respond to the filtering options
