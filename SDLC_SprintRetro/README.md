# SNHU Software Development Lifecycle Final Project
## Overview
You work for ChadaTech, a company that specializes in custom software design and development. For many years, the company has been developing their software using a waterfall development model but recently has considered shifting all of its development teams to an agile methodology that uses the Scrum framework. 

Your team has been assigned to develop an application for SNHU Travel, a travel agency seeking to expand their client base with new tools for their customers, while taking a Scrum-agile approach. ChadaTech has also asked you to lead a final Sprint Review and Retrospective of the development with your team.

For this task, you will take on the role of the Scrum Master and create a Sprint Review and Retrospective to summarize, analyze, and draw conclusions on the work you completed during the course of the development.
