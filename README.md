# SNHU Portfolio
This repo will contain various projects I've worked on throughout my journey through the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University. Some of the courses include Programming Languages, Software Develpment Lifecycle, Data Structures and Algorithms, etc. Hopefully this will provide insight into my thought process as well as show my progression over time.

## Software Management Projects
### Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) Sprint Retrospective
#### Project Overview/Analysis
This section contains a deliverable that pulls together the agile and Scrum practices that I've applied throughout the Software Development Lifecycle course. I take on the role of the Scrum Master and create a Sprint Review and Retrospective to summarize, analyze, and draw conclusions on the work completed during the course of the development lifecycle.

In this course I have learned why user stories are a great way to express user needs. It can be hard to interpret user needs and that's why there are portions of the SDLC dedicated to Planning and Designing the project before a line of code is even written. You must understand the perspective of the end-user before you can develop a product geared towards that user. To interpret these needs I could look at products that are similar to the one I'm developing and see what users like/dislike about those, as well as survey users on what they would look for in a product I'm developing. Based off of those responses I could translate those user needs into multiple user stories that take that need and define solutions I can incrementally complete.

I like to plan my programs before I begin developing and usually I would provide myself with a task list breaking down things that needed to get done. Now that I understand SDLC from this course, I realize I was pretty close to following a Waterfall methodology and in the future I would like to incorporate more agile methodologies into my project planning. Instead of trying to strictly plan out every requirement for the project, I could split that up into sprints so the work is more manageable and I can start development quicker. Then I can iterate upon what I've already built instead of trying to just work with what I had even if some of my scope or requirements have changed.

The importance of being a good team member cannot be understated especially in an agile project where communication is a must. Being a good team member means being adaptable and open minded, as well as being forthcoming with any creative ideas including the vulnerabilities of them. And of course, every good team is built or broken on communication, if it's too difficult to communicate ideas with others then that can lead to a lot of issues for a fast-paced rapidly changing process.


## C++ Projects
### Grocery Tracker
#### Project Overview/Analysis
This section contains an item-tracking program for made with C++ and Python. The program analyzes text records that contain a list of items purchased from the time a store opens to the time it closes and given that information, it can provide data about how often items are purchased.  

I think in this project I did a decent job of trying to abstract some of the common logic from my C++ file into generic classes I can utilize in multiple areas and even in projects outside of this one. I think perhaps in the future I could even take that a step further and utilize the classes in my Python code as well. I think the hardest part of the project, or at least the most time consuming when it came to debugging, was trying to make sure my input validation was looping correctly and covering most edge cases. Since most projects require input validation, I'm glad I spent a lot of time on it so I could learn a lot of the basic approaches and even made generic classes that I can reuse so I don't reinvent the wheel everytime.  

Luckily I made sure to add lots of comments, maybe even too many at some points, explaining my functions so I can come back later and easily understand what my thought process was without having to walk through every line to figure out what's going on. And of course like I've said before, I think the use of generic classes will help make this code maintainable in the future since a lot of it can be refactored independently from the rest of the program.
