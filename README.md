# C++ Projects
## Grocery Tracker
### Project Overview/Analysis
This repo contains an item-tracking program for made with C++ and Python. The program analyzes text records that contain a list of items purchased from the time a store opens to the time it closes and given that information, it can provide data about how often items are purchased.  

I think in this project I did a decent job of trying to abstract some of the common logic from my C++ file into generic classes I can utilize in multiple areas and even in projects outside of this one. I think perhaps in the future I could even take that a step further and utilize the classes in my Python code as well. I think the hardest part of the project, or at least the most time consuming when it came to debugging, was trying to make sure my input validation was looping correctly and covering most edge cases. Since most projects require input validation, I'm glad I spent a lot of time on it so I could learn a lot of the basic approaches and even made generic classes that I can reuse so I don't reinvent he wheel everytime.  

Luckily I made sure to add lots of comments, maybe even too many at some points, explaining my functions so I can come back later and easily understand what my thought process was without having to walk through every line to figure out what's going on. And of course like I've said before, I think the use of generic classes will help make this code maintainable in the future since a lot of it can be refactored independently from the rest of the program.
