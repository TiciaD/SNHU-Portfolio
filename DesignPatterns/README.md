# SNHU Design Patterns
## Overview
Our client *The Gaming Room* wants to develop a web-based game that serves multiple platforms based on their current game, Draw It or Lose It, which is currently available in an Android app only. The staff at *The Gaming Room* does not know how to set up the environment so I must step in to facilitate the development of the web-based version of the gaming app by preparing a software design document and beginning development on the game application, addressing their software requirements.

## Prototype Functionality
Create a functional game application that meets your client’s requirements incorporating common design patterns to make your code more efficient.
Address the following:
 1. Use the singleton pattern to adapt an ordinary class and explain the purpose and characteristics of the singleton pattern in the context of this application
 2. Use the iterator pattern to complete the addGame() and getGame() methods and explain the purpose and characteristics of the iterator pattern in the context of this application

## Key Points for Software Design Document
 - Executive Summary: Write a summary to introduce the software design problem and present a solution and provide the client with any critical information they must know in order to proceed with the process you are proposing.
 - Design Constraints: Identify the design constraints for developing the game application in a web-based distributed environment and explain the implications of the design constraints on application development.
 - Domain Model: Describe the UML class diagram and explain how the classes relate to each other identifying any object-oriented programming principles that are demonstrated in the diagram and how they are used to fulfill the software requirements efficiently
 - Evaluation: Evaluate the characteristics, advantages, and weaknesses of each of the various operating platforms keeping in mind the client’s requirements and look at the situation holistically, as it all has to work together
 - Recommendation: Analyze the characteristics of and techniques specific to various systems architectures and make a recommendation to The Gaming Room.
